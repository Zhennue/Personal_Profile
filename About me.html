                Hello! My name is Yeshey Zhennue, a passionate software engineering student from the scenic district of Lhuentse, Bhutan. Born on October 13, 2006, I’ve been captivated by technology and artificial intelligence from a young age, with a special interest in gaming and innovative applications. My journey has been shaped by curiosity, creativity, and a strong desire to build intelligent solutions that make life more engaging and meaningful. I’ve developed practical skills in web development, machine learning, and multilingual AI systems, and I’m particularly driven to explore the intersection of AI and gaming technologies. I’m committed to lifelong learning, constantly growing through hands-on projects, coding challenges, and real-world problem-solving. Inspired by the potential of technology to transform lives, I look forward to contributing to the world of AI, gaming, and intelligent applications with purpose and impact.
